# Coin-Clicker

Hey there! Here is the Coin Clicker Solana game! It is basically Solana's version of [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) that I made for the [Solana Speedrun Gamejam](https://solanaspeedrun.com/)

I am entering in the Fully On-Chain catagory!

And when I say *Fully* On-Chain, I mean it! Backend is written in Solana, Frontend is stored on ShadowDrive

You can even provide your RPC if you'd like! Just add in the `?rpc=` with your [encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/) rpc url!

For Example:
`http://localhost:3000?rpc=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
