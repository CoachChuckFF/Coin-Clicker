## General Info

Hey there! Here is the Coin Clicker Solana game! It is basically Solana's version of [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) that I made for the [Solana Speedrun Gamejam](https://solanaspeedrun.com/)

I am entering in the Fully On-Chain category!

And when I say *Fully* On-Chain, I mean it! Backend is written in Solana, Frontend is stored on ShadowDrive - It's truly a perma-dapp!

Go play it now! [HERE](https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/5WRCJEgy7c1Wy3ewWdfJcAePMCaUq4asyuP8sRgTQZYq/index.html) or [coinclicker.xyz](coinclicker.xyz)

You can even provide your RPC if you'd like! Just add in the `?rpc=` with your [encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/) rpc url!

For Example:
`https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/5WRCJEgy7c1Wy3ewWdfJcAePMCaUq4asyuP8sRgTQZYq/index.html?rpc=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.mainnet-beta.solana.com`

## Keys
- Game Program Key: `67714KFVqCYNTu7NUCjtMuid55dKutnXmjXpeqJEwmpu`

## Notes
- The "Player" keypair is kept in local storage - This is ***UNSAFE*** please do not put anything valuable in it. The only thing Player Keypair does is sign for the `Click` and `Upgrade` function. This was done so you don't have to approve each click.
- Submitting to the leaderboard is the only real objective of the game
- All sound effects are royalty-free and can be found at Pixabay.com - [composite sound file](https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/5WRCJEgy7c1Wy3ewWdfJcAePMCaUq4asyuP8sRgTQZYq/clicker-sounds.mp3)
- I own all of the NFTs present in the game ( although, I re-uploaded all of the artwork on shdw to keep everything together)
